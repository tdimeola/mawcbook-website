# Text Adventure: AI as Dungeon Master

No downloads, no setup. Just ask an LLM to run a text adventure for you. Be a detective, an explorer, a starship captain. The AI adapts to your choices.

## What Is a Text Adventure?

Before video games had graphics, there were text adventures. You'd read a description of where you were, type what you wanted to do, and the game would respond. It was like reading a book where you controlled the main character.

> **You are standing in a dimly lit cavern. Water drips somewhere in the darkness. To the north, a narrow passage leads deeper into the mountain. To the east, you see a faint glow.**
>
> \> *go east*
>
> **You follow the glow and emerge into a vast underground chamber. Bioluminescent mushrooms cover the walls, casting an ethereal blue light. In the center of the chamber sits an ancient stone altar.**

AI language models are perfect for this. They can generate descriptions, respond to your choices, remember context, and improvise when you do something unexpected.

## Getting Started

Go to any AI assistant (Claude, ChatGPT, Gemini) and try this prompt:

> "Let's play a text adventure game. You're the narrator and game master. I'm the player. Set the scene, describe my surroundings, and wait for me to tell you what I do. Keep descriptions vivid but concise. Track my inventory and any important information. Let's begin with me as a detective arriving at a mysterious mansion on a stormy night."

The AI will set the scene, and you respond with what you want to do:
- "Look around the room"
- "Open the door"
- "Talk to the butler"
- "Search the desk for clues"

## Genre Ideas

### Mystery / Detective
> "I'm a private investigator in 1940s Los Angeles. A wealthy widow has hired me to find out who's been stealing from her estate. Start me at the front gate of her mansion."

### Fantasy Adventure
> "I'm an apprentice wizard who just discovered a hidden door in the library of my magic school. The door wasn't there yesterday. I decide to investigate."

### Science Fiction
> "I'm the captain of a small cargo ship. We've just received a distress signal from a derelict vessel drifting at the edge of known space. We're approaching to investigate."

### Horror / Survival
> "I wake up in an abandoned hospital with no memory of how I got here. The power is flickering. I hear footsteps somewhere in the building."

### Historical
> "I'm an archaeologist in 1920s Egypt. My team has just uncovered a sealed tomb that doesn't appear on any maps. We're preparing to enter."

### Slice of Life
> "I just inherited a run-down cafe in a small coastal town. It's my first day trying to reopen it. Show me the space and the challenges ahead."

## Tips for Better Adventures

**Set clear expectations:**
> "Give me 2-3 choices at key decision points, but also let me try things not on the list. Include sensory details. If I do something dangerous, let there be real consequences."

**Ask for a character:**
> "Before we start, create a character for me with a name, a background, and a special skill. Then start the adventure."

**Request tracking:**
> "Keep track of my inventory, important NPCs I meet, and clues I discover. If I ask for a status update, summarize what I know."

**Establish the tone:**
> "Keep the tone light and adventurous with moments of humor" or "Make it atmospheric and suspenseful, like a thriller novel"

**Set stakes:**
> "My character can fail and face consequences. Don't protect me from bad decisions, but give me fair warning when something seems dangerous."

## Example Play Session

**You:** Let's play a text adventure. I'm a space salvager exploring a derelict ship. Make it atmospheric and a little creepy.

**AI:** *The airlock hisses as it cycles, and you step into the USS Meridian. Your helmet light cuts through the darkness, revealing a corridor caked with frost. The ship has been dead for six months, according to the distress beacon. No one should be here.*

*Your scanner shows faint power signatures deeper in the vessel. The corridor branches: left toward crew quarters, right toward engineering.*

*What do you do?*

**You:** Check my equipment first. What do I have?

**AI:** *You take stock of your gear:*
- *Magnetic boots (active)*
- *Plasma cutter (full charge)*
- *Scanner (showing that power signature)*
- *Emergency oxygen: 4 hours*
- *Empty salvage bag*
- *Personal sidearm (you've never had to use it)*

*The frost on the walls sparkles in your light. The silence is absolute.*

**You:** Go left toward crew quarters. Move slowly and stay alert.

And the adventure continues...

## Advanced: Collaborative Worldbuilding

You can also use AI to help *design* an adventure before playing:

> "Help me design a text adventure setting. I want a mystery aboard a luxury train traveling through an alternate-history Europe. We'll create the train, the passengers, and the central mystery together, then play through it."

This gives you a richer, more personalized experience.

## Other Text Adventure Options

If you want more structured experiences:

- **AI Dungeon** ([aidungeon.com](https://aidungeon.com)) - Dedicated text adventure platform
- **NovelAI** ([novelai.net](https://novelai.net)) - Story-focused AI with adventure modes

But honestly, a regular AI assistant works remarkably well for this, and you have more control over the experience.
