# Getting Started with Perplexity

Perplexity is different from the other AI assistants. It's designed specifically for research and always shows you the sources it used to answer your question. Think of it as an AI-powered search engine.

## Step 1: Go to Perplexity

Open your web browser and go to:

**[perplexity.ai](https://perplexity.ai)**

*The Perplexity welcome page.*

## Step 2: Start Asking Questions

You can use Perplexity without creating an account. Just type a question in the search box.

Try something like:

> "What are the health benefits of walking 10,000 steps a day?"

Press Enter.

*Just type your question and press Enter.*

## Step 3: Read the Answer with Sources

Perplexity will give you an answer and show you exactly where the information came from. You'll see numbered citations that link to the original sources.

This is incredibly useful when you need to:
- Verify information
- Read more about a topic
- Cite sources for a paper or article

*Perplexity shows its sources so you can verify the information.*

## Step 4: Ask Follow-Up Questions

After you get an answer, you can ask follow-up questions to dig deeper. Perplexity remembers the context of your conversation.

Try:
> "Are there any downsides or risks?"

or

> "What do the most recent studies say?"

## Why Use Perplexity?

- **Citations:** Every answer includes sources you can check
- **Current information:** It searches the web in real time
- **Research-focused:** Built for finding accurate information, not just chatting

## When to Use Perplexity vs. Others

- **Use Perplexity** when you need factual information with sources
- **Use Claude or ChatGPT** when you want help with writing, brainstorming, or conversation
- **Use Gemini** when you want Google integration

## What's Next?

Try the same research question in [Claude](/projects/try-different-llms/claude/), [ChatGPT](/projects/try-different-llms/chatgpt/), or [Gemini](/projects/try-different-llms/gemini/). Notice how they handle research differently.
