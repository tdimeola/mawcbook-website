# Getting Started with Microsoft Copilot

Microsoft Copilot is powered by GPT-4 (the same technology behind ChatGPT) and is integrated with Bing search. If you use Windows or Microsoft products, you may already have access to it.

## Step 1: Go to Copilot

Open your web browser and go to:

**[copilot.microsoft.com](https://copilot.microsoft.com)**

## Step 2: Sign In (Optional)

You can use Copilot without signing in, but signing in with a Microsoft account gives you:
- Longer conversations
- Chat history that saves between sessions
- Access to more features

If you have an Outlook, Hotmail, Xbox, or Microsoft 365 account, you already have a Microsoft account.

*Signing in is optional but gives you more features.*

## Step 3: Start a Conversation

Type your message in the text box at the bottom of the screen.

Try something like:

> "I'm planning a dinner party for 6 people. Can you suggest a menu that's impressive but not too complicated?"

Press Enter or click the send button.

## Step 4: Explore the Features

Copilot can:

- **Search the web** for current information
- **Generate images** using DALL-E (try: "Create an image of a cozy reading nook")
- **Analyze documents** if you upload them

## Tips for Using Copilot

- **Use conversation styles.** Copilot offers "Creative," "Balanced," and "Precise" modes that change how it responds.
- **Try image generation.** Ask it to create pictures for you.
- **Ask about current events.** It has access to Bing search.
