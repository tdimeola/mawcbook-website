# Getting Started with ChatGPT

ChatGPT is made by OpenAI and is the most widely used AI chatbot. This guide will walk you through creating an account and sending your first message.

## Step 1: Go to ChatGPT

Open your web browser and go to:

**[chat.openai.com](https://chat.openai.com)**

You'll see a welcome page with options to log in or sign up.

## Step 2: Create an Account

Click "Sign up" and you'll have options:

- **Continue with Google** - Fastest if you have a Gmail account
- **Continue with Microsoft Account** - If you use Outlook or Microsoft services
- **Continue with Apple** - If you have an Apple ID
- **Email** - Use any email address

If you choose email:
1. Enter your email address
2. Create a password
3. Check your email for a verification link
4. Click the link to verify

*Choose how you want to sign up.*

## Step 3: Start a Conversation

Once signed in, you'll see a text box at the bottom of the screen labeled "Message ChatGPT."

Try typing something like:

> "Hi! I'm new to using AI assistants. Can you tell me what kinds of things you can help with?"

Press Enter or click the send button (the arrow icon).

## Step 4: Keep Chatting

ChatGPT will respond, and you can continue the conversation. Try:

- Asking follow-up questions
- Requesting help with writing or brainstorming
- Asking it to explain something in simpler terms

## Understanding the Models

ChatGPT offers different "models" (versions of the AI):

- **GPT-3.5** - Available for free, quite capable for most tasks
- **GPT-4** - More capable, available with a paid subscription

When you're starting out, the free version is perfectly fine.

## Tips for Using ChatGPT

- **Be specific.** Vague questions get vague answers.
- **Give context.** Tell ChatGPT what you're trying to accomplish.
- **Iterate.** If the answer isn't quite right, ask it to try again differently.
- **New chat.** Click "New chat" in the sidebar to start fresh on a new topic.

## What's Next?

Now try [Claude](/projects/try-different-llms/claude/) or [Gemini](/projects/try-different-llms/gemini/) and ask them the same questions. Notice how their responses differ in tone, depth, and style.

Or head back to [Try Different LLMs](/projects/try-different-llms/) for more experiment ideas.
