# Getting Started with Claude

Claude is made by Anthropic. It's known for thoughtful, nuanced conversations and will tell you when it's not sure about something. This guide will walk you through creating an account and sending your first message.

## Step 1: Go to Claude

Open your web browser and go to:

**[claude.ai](https://claude.ai)**

You'll see a welcome page with a "Sign up" or "Get started" button.

## Step 2: Create an Account

Click "Sign up" and you'll have a few options:

- **Continue with Google** - Fastest if you have a Gmail account
- **Continue with email** - Use any email address

If you choose email, you'll need to:
1. Enter your email address
2. Check your email for a verification code
3. Enter the code on the Claude website

*Choose how you want to sign up.*

## Step 3: Start a Conversation

Once you're signed in, you'll see a text box at the bottom of the screen. This is where you type your message to Claude.

Try typing something like:

> "Hi Claude! I'm new to AI chatbots. Can you tell me a little about yourself?"

Then press Enter or click the send button.

## Step 4: Keep the Conversation Going

Claude will respond, and you can continue the conversation by typing more messages. Some things to try:

- Ask a follow-up question about something Claude said
- Ask for help with a task (writing, brainstorming, explaining something)
- Ask Claude to take on a role ("Pretend you're a travel agent helping me plan a trip")

## Tips for Using Claude

- **Be specific.** The more detail you give, the better Claude can help.
- **Correct it.** If Claude misunderstands, just say so and clarify.
- **Start fresh.** Click "New chat" in the sidebar to start a new conversation on a different topic.

## Free vs. Paid

Claude has a free tier that lets you send a limited number of messages per day. This is plenty for trying things out. If you find yourself using it a lot, there's a paid "Pro" option with higher limits and access to the most capable model.

## What's Next?

Now that you've tried Claude, consider trying [ChatGPT](/projects/try-different-llms/chatgpt/) or [Gemini](/projects/try-different-llms/gemini/) to compare how different AI assistants respond to the same questions.

Or head back to [Try Different LLMs](/projects/try-different-llms/) for experiment ideas.
