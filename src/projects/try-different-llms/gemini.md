# Getting Started with Gemini

Gemini is Google's AI assistant. If you already have a Google account (Gmail, YouTube, etc.), getting started is especially easy. Gemini can also search the web for current information.

## Step 1: Go to Gemini

Open your web browser and go to:

**[gemini.google.com](https://gemini.google.com)**

*The Gemini welcome page.*

## Step 2: Sign In with Google

If you have a Google account (Gmail), click "Sign in" and use your existing account. You don't need to create a new account.

If you don't have a Google account, you'll need to create one:
1. Click "Create account"
2. Follow the steps to set up a Google account
3. Return to gemini.google.com and sign in

*Sign in with your Google account.*

## Step 3: Start a Conversation

Once signed in, you'll see a text box where you can type your message.

Try something like:

> "Hi Gemini! What's something interesting that happened in the news today?"

Press Enter or click the send button.

## Step 4: Explore Gemini's Features

Gemini has some features the others don't:

- **Web search:** It can look up current information (news, weather, facts)
- **Google integration:** It connects with your Google services if you allow it
- **Image understanding:** You can upload images and ask questions about them

Try asking:
> "What's the weather forecast for this weekend?"

or

> "Summarize the latest news about [topic you're interested in]"

## Tips for Using Gemini

- **Use it for current events.** Gemini can search the web, so it knows recent news.
- **Be specific.** Like all AI assistants, it works better with detailed questions.
- **Try image questions.** Upload a photo and ask "What's in this image?" or "Can you identify this plant?"
