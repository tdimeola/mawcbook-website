# Build a Murder Mystery Party

Have AI generate characters with secrets, clues to scatter around your venue, and a solution that actually makes sense. Host a dinner party your friends will remember.

## What Is a Murder Mystery Party?

Guests play characters at a gathering where a "murder" has occurred. Everyone has secrets. Someone is the killer. Through conversation, clues, and accusations, players try to solve the mystery.

It's part dinner party, part improv theater, part puzzle, and it's incredibly fun.

## Why Use AI?

Traditional murder mystery kits have fixed characters and plots. With AI, you can:
- Create a mystery tailored to your group
- Set it in any time period or location
- Include inside jokes and personal references
- Adjust complexity for your players
- Generate exactly the number of characters you need

## Planning Your Party

### Decide the Basics

**Number of players:** 6-12 works best (including you as host)
**Difficulty:** Simple (one murderer, obvious clues) to complex (multiple secrets, red herrings)
**Setting:** 1920s speakeasy? Space station? Renaissance fair? Modern tech company?
**Tone:** Serious whodunit? Campy fun? Dark comedy?

### Time Needed

- **Planning:** 2-4 hours working with AI
- **Setup:** 1-2 hours before the party
- **Event:** 2-3 hours for the party itself

## Step 1: Generate Your Characters

Start with a prompt like this:

> "I'm hosting a murder mystery dinner party for 8 players. Setting: a 1920s speakeasy. I need 8 characters including the murder victim (who dies early but the player then investigates) and the murderer.
>
> For each character, give me:
> - Name and role (bartender, singer, etc.)
> - Public background (what everyone knows)
> - Secret (what they're hiding)
> - Relationship to the victim
> - One piece of evidence they possess
> - Motive (even innocents should have potential motives)
>
> Make sure the actual murderer has a solvable trail of clues but isn't obvious. Include 2-3 red herrings."

Review the characters. Ask AI to adjust anyone who doesn't feel right:

> "The singer character feels too similar to the bartender. Can you make her background more distinctive?"

## Step 2: Develop the Mystery

Once you have characters, flesh out the murder:

> "Now develop the actual murder for this mystery:
> - How was the victim killed?
> - When and where did it happen?
> - What evidence points to the killer?
> - What makes each other character look suspicious?
> - What's the timeline of the evening?
> - What should players be able to piece together?"

Get a complete picture of what happened. You need to know the truth even if your players don't.

## Step 3: Create Character Packets

Each player needs:
- Their character's background
- Their secret(s)
- What they know about other characters
- Their goals for the evening
- Props or evidence they bring

Ask AI:

> "Create a one-page character packet for [character name] that includes their background, what they know, what they're hiding, and 3-5 goals they should try to accomplish during the party."

## Step 4: Design the Clues

Physical clues make the mystery tangible:

> "Generate a list of 10-15 physical clues I can create and hide around the party space. Include:
> - What the clue is
> - What it reveals
> - Where it should be hidden
> - When/how players might find it"

Clues might include:
- A torn note
- A receipt
- A photograph
- A weapon (fake!)
- A diary entry
- A telegram or message
- An overheard conversation (scripted)

## Step 5: Plan the Structure

A typical murder mystery party flows like this:

**Arrival (30 min)**
- Guests arrive in character
- Mingle and establish relationships
- The "murder" occurs (victim dramatically "dies" or is found)

**Investigation (60-90 min)**
- Structured rounds of clue reveals
- Opportunities for private conversations
- Accusations and alibis

**Accusation (30 min)**
- Each player states who they think did it
- The truth is revealed
- Celebrate the detective (or the clever killer)

Ask AI to create a detailed schedule:

> "Create a timeline for the party, including when to reveal each clue and how to keep the energy moving."

## Step 6: Prepare Materials

**Character packets:** Print one for each guest
**Clue props:** Create physical versions of the clues
**Decorations:** Set the atmosphere for your theme
**Costume guidance:** Send guests hints about what to wear
**Name tags:** Help people remember who's who

## Hosting Tips

**Send materials early:** Give character packets 1-2 weeks ahead so players can prepare

**Encourage costumes:** Even simple ones help people get into character

**Stay flexible:** If players go off-script, roll with it

**Keep things moving:** If energy lags, reveal a new clue

**Don't play a character:** As host, be the narrator/detective who facilitates

**Feed your guests:** Mystery + dinner party = perfect combination

## Sample Themes

**Classic Noir**
1940s detective story. Femme fatales, hard-boiled detectives, suspicious millionaires.

**English Country House**
Agatha Christie style. A wealthy family, scheming servants, hidden wills.

**Space Station**
Sci-fi thriller. Crew members, corporate spies, alien artifacts.

**Hollywood Premiere**
Golden age of cinema. Stars, directors, critics, and jealous rivals.

**Renaissance Court**
Royal intrigue. Nobles, artists, courtiers, and papal emissaries.

## Making It Memorable

**Personal touches:** Name a character after someone the birthday person knows
**Real locations:** Set clues in actual spots at your venue
**Props that matter:** A real locked box with a key to find
**Photographs:** Take pictures of "evidence" featuring your actual location
**Sound effects:** Play era-appropriate music, add sound cues

## After the Party

Ask AI to help you write up:
- A summary of what really happened
- Character epilogues (what happened to everyone after)
- A "newspaper article" about the solved case

Send these to your guests as a memento.
