# Generate Your Life Story as a Movie Pitch

What genre is your life? Who plays you? What's the tagline? AI can help you see your own story from a cinematic angle.

## The Hollywood Treatment

Every life has a narrative arc, themes, dramatic moments, and character development. You just don't usually see them because you're too close.

This project uses AI to reframe your life (or a period of it) as a movie pitch. The result is entertaining, sometimes surprisingly insightful, and makes a great conversation starter.

## Step 1: Gather Your Story Elements

Think about your life in movie terms:

**The Setup:**
- Where and when were you born?
- What was your childhood like?
- What defined your early years?

**The Inciting Incident:**
- What event changed your direction?
- When did life stop being "normal"?
- What pushed you into the main story?

**The Journey:**
- What challenges have you faced?
- What have you learned?
- What have you lost and gained?

**The Characters:**
- Who are the key people in your story?
- Who's the mentor? The rival? The love interest?
- Who changed you?

**The Theme:**
- What's your story really about?
- Redemption? Discovery? Love? Survival?
- What would the audience take away?

## Step 2: Generate Your Pitch

Share your story with AI and ask for the Hollywood treatment:

> "Turn my life story into a movie pitch. I'll share the key events and people, and you write it as a professional pitch document.
>
> Background: Born in Chicago, 1985. Parents divorced when I was 7. Raised by single mom who worked two jobs. Always loved music but couldn't afford lessons. Got a scholarship to college, first in my family. Met my spouse there. After college, we moved across the country for their job, and I had to start over professionally. Struggled for years, finally started my own business at 35. It's now successful but the journey was hard.
>
> Give me:
> - Title
> - Genre
> - Logline (one sentence hook)
> - Three-act structure summary
> - Cast suggestions for who would play us
> - Tagline for the poster
> - Comparable films ('for fans of...')"

## Sample Output

## Different Angles

Try different genres for the same life:

### Comedy
> "Reframe my story as a comedy. Find the absurdity, the awkward moments, the times things went ridiculously wrong."

### Thriller
> "Make my story a thriller. What were the stakes? Who were the antagonists? What was I racing against?"

### Coming-of-Age
> "Focus on my teenage years. What was I learning? What defined that transformation?"

### Romance
> "Center the romantic relationship. How did we meet? What kept us apart? What brought us together?"

### Indie Film
> "Make this a quiet indie film. Focus on small moments and internal change rather than big drama."

## Focus on a Specific Period

Instead of your whole life:

> "Turn just my college years into a movie pitch."

> "Pitch the two years I spent caring for my sick parent."

> "Make my career change into a movie."

> "Pitch my experience becoming a parent."

## The Fun Additions

### The Trailer
> "Write a 200-word movie trailer voiceover for my life story."

### The Soundtrack
> "What songs would be on the soundtrack? Create a tracklist with what scenes they'd play during."

### The Sequel
> "My life story had a sequel hook. What's the next movie about?"

### The Director's Vision
> "Write a director's statement explaining the visual style and themes of this film."

### The Review
> "Write a 4-star movie review of my life story as if it were a real film."

## Making It Personal

### For Others
This makes a great gift. Interview a parent, grandparent, or friend, then surprise them with their movie pitch.

### For Milestones
- Retirement: Pitch the whole career
- Anniversary: Pitch the relationship
- Graduation: Pitch the school years
- Birthday: Pitch that decade

### For Perspective
When you're going through a hard time, seeing it as a movie moment can help:

> "I'm in the middle of a difficult career transition. If this were a movie, what act am I in? What's about to happen?"
