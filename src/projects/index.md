# Projects

Hands-on AI projects from *My Adventures With Claude*. Each project includes step-by-step instructions and tips for getting the best results.

## Getting Started

1. **[Try Different LLMs](/projects/try-different-llms/)**
   The best way to understand AI is to use it. This project gets you started with several major language models so you can discover how they differ and which ones suit your style.

2. **[Interview a Historical Figure](/projects/interview-historical-figure/)**
   Have a conversation with Marie Curie, Einstein, Cleopatra, or anyone who fascinates you. You'll learn something about history, and you'll discover how well AI handles nuance and character.

## Art Projects

3. **[Generate AI Art](/projects/ai-art-basics/)**
   Get started with DALL-E, Midjourney, Stable Diffusion, or other image tools. Learn basic prompting, then develop your own style.

4. **[Design Your Own Tarot Deck](/projects/tarot-deck/)**
   Use AI image generation to create custom card imagery with personal symbolism. Design the Major Arcana, or invent entirely new cards that mean something to you.

5. **[Create Album Covers for Imaginary Bands](/projects/imaginary-albums/)**
   Invent a band name, a genre, an album title, then generate the cover art. Pure creative play.

## AI Games

6. **[Text Adventure: AI as Dungeon Master](/projects/text-adventure/)**
   No downloads, no setup. Just ask an LLM to run a text adventure for you. Be a detective, an explorer, a starship captain. The AI adapts to your choices.

7. **[Simple Browser-Based AI Games](/projects/browser-games/)**
   Games you can play right now in your browser, no installation required.

8. **[Downloadable AI Games](/projects/downloadable-games/)**
   For deeper experiences: games that use AI in interesting ways and run on your own machine.

## Advanced Projects

9. **[Build a Murder Mystery Party](/projects/murder-mystery/)**
   Have AI generate characters with secrets, clues to scatter around your venue, and a solution that actually makes sense. Host a dinner party your friends will remember.

10. **[Create a Personalized Children's Book](/projects/childrens-book/)**
    Write and illustrate a story featuring a child you love: their name, their pet, their favorite things. Print it or share it digitally.

11. **[Plan Your Dream Trip](/projects/dream-trip/)**
    Build a detailed itinerary for a fantasy vacation. Even if you never go, the planning is half the fun.

12. **[Compile a Family Recipe Book](/projects/recipe-book/)**
    Gather recipes from family members, use AI to format them beautifully, add stories and variations, create something to pass down.

13. **[Design a Health and Diet Tracker](/projects/health-tracker/)**
    Work with AI to build a personalized system that fits your goals and lifestyle.

14. **[Build a Course Curriculum](/projects/curriculum-builder/)**
    Want to learn something new? Have AI design a structured learning path: readings, exercises, projects, assessments.

15. **[Make Your Own Online Game](/projects/make-a-game/)**
    Use AI to help you design and build a simple web game, even if you've never written code. From concept to playable prototype.

## Mischief

16. **[Write a Fake Wikipedia Entry](/projects/fake-wikipedia/)**
    For yourself, your pet, your house, or an invention that doesn't exist. Practice the encyclopedic tone. See how convincing you can make it.

17. **[Generate Your Life Story as a Movie Pitch](/projects/movie-pitch/)**
    What genre is your life? Who plays you? What's the tagline? AI can help you see your own story from a cinematic angle.

18. **[Learn Something Delightfully Weird](/projects/weird-learning/)**
    Pick an obscure topic: the history of cheese, medieval siege weapons, the sociology of shopping malls. Become the world's most interesting dinner party guest.

## For the Truly Ambitious

19. **[Run LLMs Locally](/projects/local-llms/)**
    For those who want privacy, offline access, or just the satisfaction of running your own AI. We'll walk you through setting up Ollama, llama.cpp, or similar tools.

20. **[Write a Book with AI](/projects/write-a-book/)**
    Use AI as a collaborator, editor, researcher, and sparring partner. It won't write the book for you, but it will help you write a better book than you could alone.

21. **[Build Your Own AI Companion](/projects/ai-companion/)**
    Turn a stuffed animal, action figure, or any object into a talking AI friend. Using a Raspberry Pi, a speaker, and a microphone, you can build a physical companion that listens and responds — a healthier, more personal alternative to commercial companion apps.
