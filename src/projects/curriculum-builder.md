# Build a Course Curriculum

Want to learn something new? Have AI design a structured learning path: readings, exercises, projects, assessments.

## Learning Anything

You can teach yourself almost anything. The hard part isn't finding information, it's organizing it into a coherent path from beginner to competent.

AI excels at this. It knows what topics depend on others, what order makes sense, and what resources exist. You provide the goal; AI provides the map.

## Step 1: Define Your Learning Goal

Be specific about what you want to learn and why:

**Too vague:** "Learn about history"
**Better:** "Understand the causes and consequences of World War I"
**Best:** "Understand WWI well enough to discuss it confidently and recognize its influence on the 20th century"

Ask yourself:
- What specifically do I want to be able to do?
- How deep do I want to go?
- How much time can I dedicate?
- What's my starting point?

## Step 2: Request a Curriculum

> "Create a 6-week self-study curriculum for learning basic statistics. I'm a complete beginner with only high school math. I can dedicate 5-6 hours per week. I want to understand statistics well enough to read and critically evaluate research studies.
>
> Include:
> - Weekly topics in logical order
> - Free online resources (videos, readings)
> - Practice exercises
> - One small project per week
> - A way to assess my understanding"

## Step 3: Review and Adjust

AI will generate a first draft. Refine it:

> "Week 2 looks too advanced for where I'll be. Can you add more basics first?"

> "I learn better from videos than reading. Can you recommend more video content?"

> "Add more practice problems. I need repetition to learn math."

## Sample Curriculum Topics

### Languages
> "Create a 3-month curriculum for learning conversational Spanish. I know no Spanish. I can practice 30 minutes daily. Focus on speaking and listening, not reading/writing."

### Creative Skills
> "Design a curriculum for learning digital illustration. I can draw a little on paper but have never used drawing software. I have an iPad with Procreate."

### Technical Skills
> "Create a curriculum for learning Python programming. I've never coded before. Goal: be able to write simple scripts to automate tasks at work."

### Academic Subjects
> "Design a self-study curriculum for understanding climate science at an undergraduate level. I have a general science background but no specialization."

### Practical Skills
> "Create a curriculum for learning home repair basics. I'm not handy at all but want to handle simple maintenance without calling someone."

### Professional Development
> "Design a curriculum for improving my public speaking skills. I can present adequately but want to become compelling and confident."

## Curriculum Components

A good curriculum includes:

### Core Content
The main material you'll learn. Readings, videos, tutorials.

### Practice
Exercises to reinforce learning. Problem sets, drills, application.

### Projects
Larger activities that combine skills. Real work, not just exercises.

### Assessment
Ways to check your understanding. Quizzes, self-tests, milestones.

### Resources
Where to find what you need. Links, books, tools.

### Schedule
Realistic pacing. What to do when, how long things take.

## Making It Work

### Start Small
> "This curriculum feels overwhelming. Can you create a 2-week trial version that covers just the fundamentals? If I stick with it, I'll continue."

### Build in Review
> "Add weekly review sessions and monthly cumulative reviews to help retention."

### Connect to Real Life
> "I'm learning Spanish for a trip to Mexico. Can you include travel-specific vocabulary and scenarios?"

### Adapt to Your Style
> "I'm an audio learner. Replace the reading suggestions with podcasts or audiobooks where possible."

## Tracking Progress

Ask AI to help you stay on track:

> "Create a simple tracking sheet for this curriculum. I want to check off completed items and note where I struggled."

Or for accountability:

> "Design a weekly self-assessment quiz for each week of this curriculum. 5-10 questions that tell me if I really understood the material."

## When You Get Stuck

Use AI as a tutor:

> "I'm on week 3 of my statistics curriculum, learning about standard deviation. I've read the material but I don't really get it. Can you explain it differently? Maybe with a concrete example?"

> "I just finished the exercise set on hypothesis testing. Can you walk me through problem 4? I got the wrong answer and don't understand why."

## Going Deeper

Once you complete a curriculum:

> "I finished the basic statistics curriculum. What should I learn next if I want to understand data science?"

Or:

> "I completed your Python basics curriculum. I want to specialize in web scraping. Create an intermediate curriculum that builds on what I've learned."

## Curated Resources

Ask for specific recommendations:

> "What are the 3 best free online courses for learning linear algebra? Compare their approaches so I can pick the right one for me."

> "Recommend 5 books on learning to draw, ordered from most beginner-friendly to most advanced."

## Sample Curriculum Format

Here's what a good curriculum might look like:

**Week 1: Foundations**
- *Topics:* What statistics is, types of data, basic terminology
- *Resources:* Khan Academy intro videos (2 hours), Chapter 1 of OpenIntro Statistics
- *Practice:* End-of-chapter exercises 1-15
- *Project:* Find 3 news articles that use statistics; identify what's being measured
- *Assessment:* Can you explain the difference between a population and a sample to a friend?

**Week 2: Describing Data**
- *Topics:* Mean, median, mode, range, variance
- *Resources:* ...

And so on.
