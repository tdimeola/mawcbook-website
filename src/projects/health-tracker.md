# Design a Health and Diet Tracker

Work with AI to build a personalized system that fits your goals and lifestyle.

## Why Personalize?

Generic health apps assume everyone wants the same things. But you might want to:
- Track specific foods for an allergy or sensitivity
- Monitor symptoms alongside meals
- Follow a particular eating approach (keto, Mediterranean, etc.)
- Focus on one habit without overwhelming data
- Create a system that actually fits your schedule

AI can help you design exactly what you need.

## Important Note

This project is for personal tracking and self-improvement. For medical conditions, work with healthcare professionals. AI is a tool for organization and reflection, not medical advice.

## What You Might Track

**Nutrition:**
- Meals and snacks
- Water intake
- Specific nutrients (protein, fiber, etc.)
- Calories (if that's helpful for you)

**Physical:**
- Exercise type and duration
- Sleep quality and duration
- Energy levels throughout the day
- Specific symptoms or conditions

**Mental/Emotional:**
- Mood
- Stress levels
- What affected your day
- Gratitude or positive moments

**Habits:**
- Medications or supplements
- Specific behaviors you're building
- Triggers you're avoiding

## Step 1: Define Your Goals

Be specific about what you want to achieve:

> "I want to track my eating habits to identify which foods give me energy vs. make me sluggish. I'm not trying to lose weight, just understand my body better. I also want to track sleep quality and daily energy levels to see patterns."

The clearer your goal, the better AI can help design your system.

## Step 2: Design Your Tracking System

Ask AI to create a custom tracker:

> "Design a daily tracking system for me. I want to log:
> - What I ate (just descriptions, not calories)
> - Energy level at 3 points (morning, afternoon, evening) on a 1-5 scale
> - Sleep quality and hours
> - One notes field for anything unusual
>
> Create this as a simple daily template I can fill out in 2 minutes. Make it work for a notebook or a spreadsheet."

Or for a spreadsheet:

> "Create a Google Sheets template for tracking my health goals. Include:
> - Daily entries for meals, water, exercise
> - Weekly summary calculations
> - A simple chart that updates automatically
> - Color coding for hitting targets
>
> Give me the column headers and any formulas I'll need."

## Step 3: Establish Your Baseline

Before making changes, understand where you are:

> "I'm going to track my eating for one week without changing anything. What should I pay attention to? What patterns should I look for when I review the data?"

AI can help you identify what to notice and how to analyze it.

## Step 4: Analyze and Adjust

After collecting data, use AI to find insights:

> "Here's a week of my food and energy tracking:
> [paste your data]
>
> What patterns do you see? Are there any correlations between what I ate and my energy levels?"

Or:

> "I've noticed I always feel tired around 3pm. Looking at my food logs, what might be causing this? What could I try differently?"

## Step 5: Iterate Your System

After using your tracker for a while:

> "I've been using this tracking system for a month. The meal logging works well, but I keep forgetting the evening energy check. How can I simplify this or make it easier to remember?"

Your system should evolve to fit your life.

## Different Approaches

### The Minimal Tracker
Track just one thing. Master it before adding more.

> "Create the simplest possible water tracking system. I just want to make sure I drink enough water each day."

### The Correlator
Track multiple things to find connections.

> "I get headaches 2-3 times a week. Create a tracker that logs potential triggers: sleep, stress, caffeine, screen time, meals, weather, hydration. After a month, help me analyze what's correlated."

### The Habit Builder
Focus on building new behaviors.

> "I want to build three habits: morning stretching, daily walk, and no phone before bed. Design a simple tracking system with a streak counter for each."

### The Food Detective
Understand how foods affect you.

> "I'm doing an elimination diet to identify food sensitivities. Create a tracker that logs what I eat, any symptoms (digestive, skin, energy), and their timing and severity."

## Tools to Use

**Paper journal:**
- Simple and always available
- Ask AI to design a template you can photocopy

**Spreadsheet (Google Sheets, Excel):**
- Easy to analyze
- Can add formulas and charts
- Ask AI for formulas you need

**Notion or similar:**
- Flexible templates
- Daily log with properties
- Can build dashboards

**Dedicated apps:**
- Use AI to help configure them
- Or to export/analyze their data

## Weekly Reviews

Set aside time to review your data:

> "Here's my tracking data from this week:
> [paste data]
>
> Give me a brief analysis:
> - How did I do on my goals?
> - What patterns do you notice?
> - What's one thing to try next week?"

## When It's Working

A good tracking system:
- Takes less than 5 minutes daily
- Shows you useful patterns
- Motivates rather than stresses you
- Evolves with your needs
- Can be paused and resumed

If your system is causing stress or obsession, simplify it or take a break.
