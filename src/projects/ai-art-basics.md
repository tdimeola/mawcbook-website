# Generate AI Art

Get started with DALL-E, Midjourney, Stable Diffusion, or other image tools. Learn basic prompting, then develop your own style.

## How AI Image Generation Works

You type a description of what you want to see, and the AI creates an image. It sounds simple, but the results can be stunning, strange, or surprisingly specific depending on how you phrase your request.

These tools have been trained on millions of images and their descriptions. They've learned relationships between words and visual concepts: what "sunset" looks like, what "art nouveau" means, how "melancholy" might appear in a portrait.

## Your First Image

Let's start with Microsoft Copilot since it's free and easy.

1. Go to [copilot.microsoft.com](https://copilot.microsoft.com)
2. Type: "Create an image of a cozy reading nook with a cat sleeping on a velvet armchair, afternoon sunlight through the window, warm colors" 

**NOTE** You may be asked a few questions about your identity. Yes it's annoying. Unfortunately bad actors have pushed websites like this, and others, to extreme security. Don't think of it as a nuisance, but as a way we and our work are being protected.

3. Wait about 30 seconds
4. You'll get several variations to choose from

That's it. You've just created AI art.

## The Anatomy of a Good Prompt

A detailed prompt typically includes:

**Subject:** What's in the image
> "a lighthouse on a rocky cliff"

**Style:** How it should look
> "watercolor painting" or "photorealistic" or "Studio Ghibli style"

**Mood/Atmosphere:** The feeling it evokes
> "dramatic and stormy" or "peaceful and serene"

**Lighting:** How the scene is lit
> "golden hour sunlight" or "neon lights" or "soft diffused light"

**Composition:** How elements are arranged
> "wide shot" or "close-up portrait" or "bird's eye view"

**Details:** Specific elements you want included
> "seagulls in the distance, waves crashing, old wooden door"

## Example Prompts to Try

**Cozy and warm:**
> "A small bakery in Paris at dawn, warm light glowing from the windows, fresh bread visible inside, cobblestone street wet from rain, watercolor style with soft edges"

**Dramatic landscape:**
> "Ancient temple ruins in a jungle, shafts of golden sunlight breaking through the canopy, vines and moss covering the stone, cinematic wide shot, photorealistic"

**Whimsical character:**
> "A friendly robot gardener tending to glowing mushrooms, steampunk aesthetic, warm copper tones, illustrated children's book style"

**Abstract concept:**
> "The feeling of nostalgia visualized as a landscape, faded photographs floating in a golden sky, childhood toys scattered across rolling hills, dreamy and surreal"

## Common Mistakes and How to Fix Them

**Problem:** Image is too generic
**Solution:** Add specific details. Instead of "a forest," try "an ancient redwood forest with shafts of morning light, ferns covering the forest floor, a winding dirt path"

**Problem:** Wrong style
**Solution:** Be more explicit about medium. Add "oil painting" or "3D render" or "pencil sketch"

**Problem:** Elements are missing
**Solution:** Put important elements early in your prompt. AI pays more attention to the beginning.

**Problem:** Weird anatomy on people/animals
**Solution:** This is a known limitation. Try different angles, simpler poses, or crop to avoid problem areas.

**Problem:** Text in the image looks garbled
**Solution:** Most AI struggles with text. Either avoid it, use Ideogram (which handles text better), or add text afterward in an image editor.

## Iterating and Refining

Your first result is rarely your final result. The process:

1. Generate an initial image
2. Note what you like and don't like
3. Adjust your prompt
4. Generate again
5. Repeat until satisfied

You might also:
- Ask for variations of an image you like
- Use an image you generated as a starting point for a new generation
- Combine elements from different results in an image editor

## Building Your Style

As you practice, you'll develop preferences. Keep notes on:

- Phrases that consistently produce results you like
- Color palettes that appeal to you
- Artists or styles that match your aesthetic
- Aspect ratios you prefer

Save your best prompts. They become your personal toolkit.

## Ethical Considerations

AI image generation raises real questions:

- These tools were trained on images made by human artists
- Some artists feel their work was used without consent
- AI can replicate living artists' styles
- There are ongoing debates about copyright and attribution

Different tools handle this differently. Adobe Firefly, for example, was trained only on licensed content. Consider these issues as you explore.
