# Simple Browser-Based AI Games

Games you can play right now in your browser, no installation required.

## Why Browser Games?

Sometimes you just want to play. No setup, no downloads, no accounts. Just open a page and start having fun.

These games use AI in interesting ways, from generating content to creating opponents to building entire worlds. They run in your browser, so you can try them on any device.

## Word and Trivia Games

### Semantle
**[semantle.com](https://semantle.com)**

Guess the secret word using semantic similarity. The game tells you how "close" your guess is based on meaning, not spelling. It uses AI word embeddings to measure similarity.

*Example: If the word is "ocean," guessing "sea" might score 95%, while "blue" scores 40%.*

### Absurdle
**[qntm.org/files/absurdle/absurdle.html](https://qntm.org/files/absurdle/absurdle.html)**

Adversarial Wordle. The game doesn't pick a word at the start. Instead, it actively avoids your guesses, always choosing from the largest remaining set of possible words. Can you corner it?

### AI Dungeon (Web Version)
**[play.aidungeon.com](https://play.aidungeon.com)**

Text adventures generated by AI. Type anything and the story adapts. Free tier available, though limited.

## Creative Games

### Quick, Draw!
**[quickdraw.withgoogle.com](https://quickdraw.withgoogle.com)**

Google's neural network tries to guess what you're drawing. You have 20 seconds to sketch something (like "cat" or "bicycle"), and the AI guesses in real time. It's trained on millions of drawings from other players.

### Autodraw
**[autodraw.com](https://autodraw.com)**

Start sketching, and AI suggests what you might be drawing, then offers to replace your scribbles with professional clip art. Great for people who can't draw (most of us).

### This Person Does Not Exist
**[thispersondoesnotexist.com](https://thispersondoesnotexist.com)**

Not a game exactly, but fascinating. Every time you refresh, AI generates a completely new human face. These people don't exist. Worth a few minutes of contemplation.

## Puzzle and Strategy

### Akinator
**[akinator.com](https://akinator.com)**

Think of any character (real or fictional), and the AI genie will guess who you're thinking of by asking yes/no questions. It's eerily accurate, even for obscure characters.

### Little Alchemy 2
**[littlealchemy2.com](https://littlealchemy2.com)**

Combine elements to create new things. Start with air, water, fire, and earth. End up with unicorns, computers, and the meaning of life. The combinations aren't AI-generated, but the logic system is satisfyingly complex.

## Experimental and Artistic

### Infinite Craft
**[neal.fun/infinite-craft](https://neal.fun/infinite-craft)**

Combine any two concepts to create new ones, infinitely. Start with Water, Fire, Wind, and Earth. Combine them to make Steam, Mud, Dust. Keep combining to discover increasingly absurd creations. AI generates new combinations on the fly.

### Scribble Diffusion
**[scribblediffusion.com](https://scribblediffusion.com)**

Draw a rough sketch, add a text description, and AI turns your scribble into a more polished image. Free and instant.

### Talk to Transformer
**[app.inferkit.com/demo](https://app.inferkit.com/demo)**

Type the beginning of a story, article, or conversation, and AI continues it. Simple but endlessly entertaining for seeing where AI takes your ideas.

## Multiplayer

### Gartic Phone (with AI)
**[garticphone.com](https://garticphone.com)**

The telephone game meets Pictionary. Write a sentence, someone draws it, someone else describes that drawing, and so on. Some modes include AI-generated elements. Best with friends.

### AI-Powered Chess (chess.com)
**[chess.com](https://chess.com)**

Play against AI opponents of any skill level. The AI adapts to challenge you appropriately. Free to play.

## Tips for Exploring

- **Start with Quick, Draw!** - It's immediately fun and shows AI recognition in action
- **Try Semantle if you like word puzzles** - It's addictive once you understand the concept
- **Infinite Craft for relaxed exploration** - No pressure, just discovery

## What Makes These Games "AI"?

These games use AI in different ways:

- **Recognition:** Quick, Draw! identifies your sketches
- **Generation:** AI Dungeon creates story content
- **Prediction:** Akinator narrows down possibilities
- **Similarity:** Semantle measures word relationships
- **Adaptation:** Chess AI adjusts to your skill level

Playing them gives you intuition for what AI is good at (pattern recognition, content generation) and where it struggles (true creativity, common sense).
