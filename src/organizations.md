# Organizations Working on Universal AI Access

The vision outlined in Chapter 14 — bringing AI to the 2.2 billion people without internet access — isn't starting from scratch. Organizations around the world are already working on pieces of this puzzle: digital infrastructure, offline technology, AI in local languages, community access centers, and more.

This page catalogs organizations you can support, partner with, or learn from.

## Major International Initiatives

These organizations coordinate large-scale efforts across governments, corporations, and civil society.

### EDISON Alliance (World Economic Forum)

**What they do:** A coalition of 200+ partners that has connected over 1 billion people to essential digital services in healthcare, education, and finance across 100+ countries — ahead of their 2025 target.

**Why it matters:** Proof that coordinated public-private partnerships can achieve scale. Their "Lighthouse Countries Network" (Ethiopia, Ghana, Nigeria, Rwanda, and others) provides models for national digital inclusion programs.

## Digital Literacy and Education

Organizations bringing reading, learning, and digital skills to underserved populations.

### Worldreader

**What they do:** A global nonprofit that has supported 22+ million readers in 100+ countries since 2010. Their BookSmart app offers 3,000+ books in multiple languages (English, Swahili, Arabic, Hindi, Spanish) for children ages 3-12.

**Why it matters:** They've solved the "offline-first" problem — their app works without constant connectivity. Their partnership model (working with Ministries of Education, local NGOs, corporate partners like Safaricom) is replicable.

**Impact:** Studies show reading speed and comprehension significantly increased after just five months of use. Won the 2023 Library of Congress Literacy Award.

- **Website:** [worldreader.org](https://www.worldreader.org)
- **Where they work:** Ghana, Kenya, Uganda, South Africa, Egypt, India, and more

### Khan Academy

**What they do:** Free, world-class education for anyone, anywhere. Increasingly used in Global South countries and has been developing offline capabilities.

**Why it matters:** Demonstrates that high-quality educational content can be delivered at zero marginal cost. Their content is being used by many other digital inclusion initiatives.

## African AI and Language Technology

Organizations building AI that actually works for African languages and contexts.

### Masakhane

**What they do:** A grassroots organization building Natural Language Processing (NLP) tools for African languages. "Masakhane" means "We build together" in isiZulu. Over 1,000 contributors from 30+ African countries have created machine translation benchmarks for 52+ African languages.

**Why it matters:** This is exactly what Chapter 14's vision requires — AI that speaks local languages. Masakhane proves it can be done by Africans, for Africans, with community ownership of data.

**Key principle:** Data sovereignty — Africans should decide what data represents their communities and retain ownership of it.

- **Website:** [masakhane.io](https://www.masakhane.io)
- **GitHub:** [github.com/masakhane-io](https://github.com/masakhane-io)
- **How to help:** Train models, contribute datasets, provide compute resources, or mentor

### Ghana NLP

**What they do:** Developing NLP tools specifically for Ghanaian languages, working closely with the Masakhane community.

**Why it matters:** Country-specific focus allows deeper engagement with local linguistic and cultural context.

- **Website:** [ghananlp.org](https://ghananlp.org)

### Lanfrica

**What they do:** A directory and repository of African NLP datasets, making it easier for researchers and developers to find and use African language data.

**Why it matters:** Addresses the critical data gap — you can't build AI for a language without data in that language.

## Agricultural AI

AI helping the farmers who feed the world.

### Farmerline (Ghana)

**What they do:** Dubbed the "Amazon for African farmers," Farmerline provides smallholder farmers with access to fertilizer, seeds, climate-smart farming education, and market connections. Their **Darli AI** chatbot provides instant farming advice in 27 languages (including Twi, Swahili, Yoruba) via WhatsApp.

**Why it matters:** This is the closest existing model to Chapter 14's vision:
- Works in local languages
- Accessible via WhatsApp (low bandwidth)
- **Works without smartphones** — farmers can call or text an AI helpline
- Already reaching 2.3+ million farmers across 50 countries

**Impact:** 30% productivity boost for farmers using the platform. Supported by the Green Climate Fund.

- **Website:** [farmerline.co](https://farmerline.co)
- **Countries:** Ghana, Cote d'Ivoire, Togo, Benin, Burkina Faso, expanding across West Africa

### Opportunity International — FarmerAI

**What they do:** AI-powered tools for smallholder farmers, focusing on financial inclusion alongside agricultural support.

**Why it matters:** Combines agricultural AI with microfinance, addressing multiple barriers simultaneously.

- **Website:** [opportunity.org](https://opportunity.org)

## Healthcare AI

AI improving health outcomes in underserved communities.

### PATH

**What they do:** A global health nonprofit headquartered in Seattle, working to advance health equity. They've appointed a Chief AI Officer and are integrating AI to improve diagnostic accuracy, streamline health supply chains, and guide disease surveillance.

**Why it matters:** PATH has deep relationships with health ministries in developing countries. When they adopt AI tools, they bring implementation expertise and trust relationships.

- **Website:** [path.org](https://www.path.org)

### Operation Smile

**What they do:** Provides free cleft lip and palate surgeries worldwide. In collaboration with Microsoft, they've integrated AI to analyze surgical photographs and train surgeons in remote areas.

**Why it matters:** Demonstrates AI as a tool for training and quality assurance in healthcare, not just diagnosis.

## Connectivity Infrastructure

The physical layer — getting internet to places that don't have it.

### Satellite Internet

| Project | Organization | Status |
|---------|--------------|--------|
| **Starlink** | SpaceX | Operational in 70+ countries, expanding to remote areas |
| **Project Kuiper** | Amazon | Launching 2025-2026, aims for global coverage |
| **OneWeb** | Eutelsat OneWeb | Operational, focus on enterprise and government |

**Why it matters:** Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellite constellations can provide internet to areas where laying fiber or building cell towers is impractical. Cost is dropping rapidly.

### Undersea Cables

| Cable | Organization | Route |
|-------|--------------|-------|
| **2Africa** | Meta | Circles entire African continent, 46 landing points |
| **Equiano** | Google | Europe to South Africa via West Africa |

**Why it matters:** These cables dramatically increase bandwidth capacity to the African continent, reducing costs and enabling services that weren't previously feasible.

## Community Technology Centers

Shared spaces providing community access to digital technology.

### The Telecenter Model

**What it is:** Community spaces with computers, internet access, and trained facilitators. Originated in Scandinavia in the 1980s, spread globally in the 1990s-2000s as "telecenters," "community information centers," or "digital villages."

**Current status:** Research shows telecenters complement (not compete with) smartphones — complex tasks still benefit from larger screens, keyboards, and in-person support. Ghana's Community Information Centers significantly improved youth digital literacy and employment outcomes.

**Key insight:** The community center model that Chapter 14 proposes for AI access builds on decades of experience with telecenters. We know what works and what doesn't.

**Challenges:** Sustainability, reaching the poorest populations (not just emerging middle class), keeping technology current.

## The Big Picture

The infrastructure for universal AI access is being built right now, in pieces, by organizations around the world. What's missing is coordination and scale.

Chapter 14 of *My Adventures With Claude* lays out a vision for how these pieces could come together — community AI centers, offline-capable models, voice interfaces in local languages, multi-stakeholder funding.

The organizations on this page prove it's not a fantasy. The technology exists. The models work. The question is whether we choose to deploy them at the scale the world needs.
