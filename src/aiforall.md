# AI for All: Taking Action

This page provides resources for readers who want to advocate for responsible AI development, universal AI access, and policies that protect consumers while enabling innovation.

## Why This Matters

AI is developing faster than policy can keep up. The decisions being made now — by governments, corporations, and international bodies — will shape how AI affects billions of lives for decades to come.

You have a voice. Here's how to use it.

## Sample Letter Template

Feel free to adapt this for your own use:

> Dear [Representative's Name],
>
> As your constituent, I'm writing about the rapid development of artificial intelligence and the urgent need for thoughtful policy.
>
> AI systems are already making decisions that affect hiring, lending, healthcare, and criminal justice. Many of these systems operate without transparency or accountability. Consumers often don't know when AI is being used, can't challenge decisions, and have no recourse when things go wrong.
>
> I urge you to support legislation that:
> - Requires transparency when AI systems make consequential decisions
> - Mandates independent auditing of high-stakes AI applications
> - Invests in AI literacy education for all Americans
> - Ensures AI development benefits everyone, not just those who can afford it
>
> AI can be an enormous force for good, but only if we shape its development wisely. Thank you for your attention to this important issue.
>
> Sincerely,
> [Your Name]
> [Your Address]

## Support Organizations Doing This Work

Advocacy is powerful, but so is direct support. Organizations around the world are already building the infrastructure for universal AI access — community technology centers, AI in local languages, offline-capable tools, agricultural and healthcare AI for underserved populations.

**[See our full directory of organizations working on universal AI access →](/organizations/)**

Highlights:
- **[Worldreader](https://www.worldreader.org)** — 22M+ readers in 100+ countries with offline-capable apps
- **[Masakhane](https://www.masakhane.io)** — Grassroots AI for 52+ African languages
- **[Farmerline](https://farmerline.co)** — AI farming advice in 27 languages, works without smartphones
- **[EDISON Alliance](https://www.edisonalliance.org)** — Connected 1B+ people to digital services

## For the Ambitious: Start Something New

Chapter 14 of *My Adventures With Claude* lays out a vision for a Global AI Access Initiative — community AI centers serving the 2.2 billion people without internet access, funded through multi-stakeholder partnerships.

If you're ready to build something at that scale, we've compiled resources on:
- Impact investment prospectus templates
- Development bank proposal structures
- Multi-stakeholder funding strategies
- Budget frameworks for community technology projects
