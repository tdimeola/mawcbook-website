# About the Author

TJ DiMeola - Teresa J. DiMeola has degrees in mechanical engineering (BEME), computer science (MSCSc), fine art (MFA),
and is a PhD candidate at the University of Mississippi (Ole Miss), in Computer and Information Sciences.

Her current research involves giving LLMs like Claude persistent memory, and teaching AI to recognize things it has never seen before.

At other times, the author can be found having fun playing with embodied AI (robots), painting pictures, or watching helplessly as four very cute bunnies chew all available cables.
