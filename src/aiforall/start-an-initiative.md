# Start a Digital Inclusion Initiative

This page is for the ambitious few who want to build something new — not just support existing organizations, but create infrastructure for universal AI access at scale.

Chapter 14 of *My Adventures With Claude* outlines a vision: community AI centers serving the 2.2 billion people without internet access, using offline-capable AI in local languages, funded through multi-stakeholder partnerships.

Below are the practical resources to make that vision real.

## Before You Begin

**Honest assessment:** Starting a global initiative requires:
- Deep expertise in international development, technology, or both
- Existing relationships with potential funders and partners
- Years of runway (this is not a quick project)
- Willingness to fail publicly

**Consider first:**
1. Can you achieve your goals by supporting [existing organizations](/organizations/)?
2. Is there a local or regional gap you could fill without building from scratch?
3. Do you have a unique advantage (connections, expertise, resources) that justifies a new initiative?

If the answer is still "I need to build something new," read on.

## The Multi-Stakeholder Funding Model

No single entity will fund universal AI access alone. The strategy is blended financing from multiple stakeholder types, each contributing for different reasons.

### Stakeholder Types and Their Motivations

| Stakeholder | Why They Fund | What They Contribute | Typical Range |
|-------------|---------------|---------------------|---------------|
| **Tech Companies** | Market expansion, PR, future users | Cash, technology, expertise | $50-200M |
| **Development Banks** | Core mission alignment | Loans, grants, technical assistance | $100-400M |
| **National Governments** | Political benefit, economic development | Infrastructure, personnel, regulatory support | $50-100M per country |
| **Telecoms** | Future customer base, demand creation | Data subsidies, infrastructure sharing | $50-100M |
| **Philanthropic Foundations** | Impact at scale | Grants, convening power | $20-50M each |

### The Funding Sequence

**Phase 1: Anchor Commitment ($200-300M)**

You need one major player to commit first. This validates the effort and makes subsequent fundraising dramatically easier.

*Best targets:*
- Tech companies with AI products seeking emerging market expansion
- Billionaire philanthropists seeking transformative impact
- Emerging market tech giants who see their own populations in the problem

*The pitch:* "You're building AI for the connected world. We're giving you access to 2.2 billion unconnected people who will become your users. First-mover advantage. Plus, this is the best PR your company will ever get."

**Phase 2: Development Bank Partnership ($300-400M)**

With anchor funding secured, approach development banks.

*Targets:* World Bank, Asian Development Bank, African Development Bank, Inter-American Development Bank

*The pitch:* "This directly advances your core mission — economic development, poverty reduction, health, education — using proven technology at unprecedented scale. And you have a tech sector co-funding partner already committed."

*Structure:* Development banks don't just give grants. They offer:
- Concessional loans to participating governments
- Technical assistance grants
- Risk guarantees
- Co-financing with bilateral aid agencies

**Phase 3: Government Partnerships ($200-300M)**

National governments with large rural populations are obvious stakeholders.

*Targets:* India, Indonesia, Nigeria, Bangladesh, Brazil, Kenya

*The pitch:* "Your rural populations are falling further behind. This builds human capital, increases agricultural productivity, improves health outcomes — all for less than you spend on failed subsidy programs."

**Phase 4: Telecom Partnerships ($100-200M)**

This is enlightened self-interest.

*The pitch:* "We're creating demand for your services. People who've never needed internet will suddenly need it for AI updates, expanded services. This builds your future customer base."

**Phase 5: Philanthropic Foundations ($100-200M)**

After you have tech, banks, and governments committed, foundations will follow.

*Target types:*
- Global health foundations (Gates Foundation, Wellcome Trust)
- Education-focused foundations
- Technology-for-good foundations

## Realistic Assessment

**What makes this possible:**
- Technology exists RIGHT NOW
- Cost is manageable (~$50B over 10 years = a rounding error globally)
- Offline AI works
- Community models are proven (libraries, health clinics, telecenters)
- Mobile money infrastructure exists in key regions

**What makes it hard:**
- Political will is lacking
- No coordination between tech sector, development sector, governments
- Treated as "charity" not "critical infrastructure"
- Some governments actively hostile to informed populations
- 100+ languages need coverage
- Ongoing funding (not just setup)

**The real barrier:** This is SOLVABLE but not PROFITABLE in the short term. It requires treating AI access like we treated universal literacy in the 20th century — as a public good, a human right, critical infrastructure.

The question isn't "Can this be funded?" It's "Who has the vision to be first?"
