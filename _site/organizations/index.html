    <h1>Organizations Working on Universal AI Access</h1>
<p>The vision outlined in Chapter 14 — bringing AI to the 2.2 billion people without internet access — isn't starting from scratch. Organizations around the world are already working on pieces of this puzzle: digital infrastructure, offline technology, AI in local languages, community access centers, and more.</p>
<p>This page catalogs organizations you can support, partner with, or learn from.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Major International Initiatives</h2>
<p>These organizations coordinate large-scale efforts across governments, corporations, and civil society.</p>
<h3>EDISON Alliance (World Economic Forum)</h3>

<h3>Farmerline (Ghana)</h3>
<p><strong>What they do:</strong> Dubbed the &quot;Amazon for African farmers,&quot; Farmerline provides smallholder farmers with access to fertilizer, seeds, climate-smart farming education, and market connections. Their <strong>Darli AI</strong> chatbot provides instant farming advice in 27 languages (including Twi, Swahili, Yoruba) via WhatsApp.</p>
<p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> This is the closest existing model to Chapter 14's vision:</p>
<ul>
<li>Works in local languages</li>
<li>Accessible via WhatsApp (low bandwidth)</li>
<li><strong>Works without smartphones</strong> — farmers can call or text an AI helpline</li>
<li>Already reaching 2.3+ million farmers across 50 countries</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> These cables dramatically increase bandwidth capacity to the African continent, reducing costs and enabling services that weren't previously feasible.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Community Technology Centers</h2>
<p>Shared spaces providing community access to digital technology.</p>
<h3>The Telecenter Model</h3>
<p><strong>What it is:</strong> Community spaces with computers, internet access, and trained facilitators. Originated in Scandinavia in the 1980s, spread globally in the 1990s-2000s as &quot;telecenters,&quot; &quot;community information centers,&quot; or &quot;digital villages.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Current status:</strong> Research shows telecenters complement (not compete with) smartphones — complex tasks still benefit from larger screens, keyboards, and in-person support. Ghana's Community Information Centers significantly improved youth digital literacy and employment outcomes.</p>
<p><strong>Key insight:</strong> The community center model that Chapter 14 proposes for AI access builds on decades of experience with telecenters. We know what works and what doesn't.</p>
<p><strong>Challenges:</strong> Sustainability, reaching the poorest populations (not just emerging middle class), keeping technology current.</p>

<h2>The Big Picture</h2>
<p>The infrastructure for universal AI access is being built right now, in pieces, by organizations around the world. What's missing is coordination and scale.</p>
<p>Chapter 14 of <em>My Adventures With Claude</em> lays out a vision for how these pieces could come together — community AI centers, offline-capable models, voice interfaces in local languages, multi-stakeholder funding.</p>
<p>The organizations on this page prove it's not a fantasy. The technology exists. The models work. The question is whether we choose to deploy them at the scale the world needs.</p>
