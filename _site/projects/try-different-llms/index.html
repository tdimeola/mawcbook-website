    <h1>Try Different LLMs</h1>
<p>The best way to understand AI is to use it. This project gets you started with several major language models so you can discover how they differ and which ones suit your style.</p>
<h2>Where to Start</h2>
<p>We recommend starting with one of these three. All have free options, and each has a different personality. Click on any of them for step-by-step instructions on creating an account and sending your first message.</p>
<h3><a href="/projects/try-different-llms/claude/">Claude (by Anthropic)</a></h3>
<p>Claude is known for nuanced conversation, careful reasoning, and a warm personality. It tends to be thoughtful about ethical questions and will tell you when it's uncertain. Good for long conversations, writing assistance, analysis, and coding help.</p>
<h3><a href="/projects/try-different-llms/chatgpt/">ChatGPT (by OpenAI)</a></h3>
<p>The most widely used LLM. ChatGPT is versatile and capable across many tasks. The free version uses GPT-3.5; the paid version uses GPT-4, which is more capable. Good for general questions, creative writing, coding, and brainstorming.</p>
<h3><a href="/projects/try-different-llms/gemini/">Gemini (by Google)</a></h3>
<p>Google's offering, integrated with Google services. Good at factual questions and can access current information through search. Good for research, fact-checking, and questions about current events.</p>
<h2>Other Options Worth Exploring</h2>
<p>Once you're comfortable with the basics, you might also try:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="/projects/try-different-llms/copilot/">Microsoft Copilot</a></strong> - Powered by GPT-4, integrated with Bing search</li>
<li><strong><a href="/projects/try-different-llms/perplexity/">Perplexity</a></strong> - Focused on research and citations</li>
</ul>
<h2>Your First Experiment</h2>
<p>Once you've tried one LLM, try asking the same question to a different one. Notice:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Tone:</strong> Which feels more natural to talk to?</li>
<li><strong>Depth:</strong> Which gives more thorough answers?</li>
<li><strong>Honesty:</strong> Which admits uncertainty vs. sounds confident about everything?</li>
<li><strong>Style:</strong> Which matches how you like to receive information?</li>
</ol>
<h3>Sample Questions to Try</h3>
<p><strong>For personality comparison:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;I'm feeling overwhelmed by how much there is to learn about AI. Where should I start?&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>For reasoning:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Help me think through whether I should take a new job that pays more but requires relocating away from family.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>For creativity:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Write a short scene where a detective interrogates a talking cat.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>For technical help:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Explain how a neural network learns, as if I'm a curious 12-year-old.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Tips for Getting Good Results</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Be specific.</strong> Instead of &quot;tell me about dogs,&quot; try &quot;what are the best dog breeds for apartment living with a cat?&quot;</li>
<li><strong>Give context.</strong> Tell the AI who you are and what you're trying to accomplish.</li>
<li><strong>Ask follow-up questions.</strong> The conversation improves as you go.</li>
<li><strong>Try rephrasing.</strong> If an answer isn't quite right, ask again differently.</li>
</ul>
<h2>What You'll Discover</h2>
<p>After trying several LLMs, most people find they prefer one for certain tasks. There's no single &quot;best&quot; LLM. The best one is the one that works well for what you need.</p>
<h2>Next Steps</h2>
<p>Once you're comfortable chatting with LLMs, try <a href="/projects/interview-historical-figure/">Interview a Historical Figure</a> to see how well these AIs can take on a persona.</p>
