    <h1>Write a Fake Wikipedia Entry</h1>
<p>For yourself, your pet, your house, or an invention that doesn't exist. Practice the encyclopedic tone. See how convincing you can make it.</p>
<h2>Why This Is Fun</h2>
<p>Wikipedia has a very specific voice: authoritative, neutral, exhaustively sourced, slightly dry. When you apply that voice to mundane or ridiculous subjects, something magical happens.</p>
<p>Your cat becomes a &quot;notable feline specimen with documented behavioral idiosyncrasies.&quot; Your garage band becomes a &quot;influential underground musical collective.&quot; Your childhood blanket becomes an &quot;object of historical significance.&quot;</p>
<p>It's funny, but it also teaches you a lot about how authority is constructed through writing.</p>
<h2>The Wikipedia Style</h2>
<p>Real Wikipedia articles share characteristics:</p>
<p><strong>Third person:</strong> &quot;John Smith is...&quot; not &quot;I am...&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Neutral tone:</strong> Facts without enthusiasm or criticism</p>
<p><strong>Weasel-free:</strong> Specific claims, not &quot;many people say...&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Citations:</strong> [1] [2] [3] everywhere</p>
<p><strong>Structured:</strong> Sections, subsections, infoboxes</p>
<p><strong>Encyclopedic scope:</strong> Context, significance, impact</p>
<h2>Step 1: Choose Your Subject</h2>
<p><strong>Yourself:</strong>
Write your own Wikipedia biography as if you were notable.</p>
<p><strong>Your pet:</strong>
Document their habits, achievements, and cultural significance.</p>
<p><strong>Your house or apartment:</strong>
Its architectural history, notable residents, cultural impact.</p>
<p><strong>An imaginary invention:</strong>
Something that sounds real but doesn't exist.</p>
<p><strong>A fictional place:</strong>
The town you grew up in, but wildly embellished.</p>
<p><strong>An event:</strong>
That one party, vacation, or family gathering, as if it were historically significant.</p>
<h2>Step 2: Generate the Entry</h2>
<p>Ask AI to help:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Write a Wikipedia-style article about my cat, Mr. Whiskers. Include:</p>
<ul>
<li>An opening paragraph establishing his notability</li>
<li>An 'Early Life' section</li>
<li>A 'Behavioral Characteristics' section written like a scientific paper</li>
<li>A 'Cultural Impact' section about how he's affected our household</li>
<li>Citations to made-up sources like 'Journal of Feline Studies'</li>
<li>An infobox with his vital statistics</li>
</ul>
<p>Real details: He's an orange tabby, adopted in 2019, loves sitting in boxes, knocks things off tables, weighs 14 pounds.</p>
<p>Make it sound completely serious and authoritative.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Step 3: Add the Details</h2>
<p>The magic is in the specifics:</p>
<p><strong>Infobox:</strong></p>
<pre><code>| Mr. Whiskers |
| Born: circa 2018 (estimated) |
| Species: Felis catus |
| Breed: Domestic shorthair (orange tabby) |
| Known for: Box occupancy, gravity experiments |
| Weight: 14 lbs (6.4 kg) |
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Fake citations:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Thompson, R. &quot;Territorial Behaviors in Domestic Cats.&quot; <em>Journal of Feline Psychology</em>, vol. 23, 2021.</li>
<li>Martinez, S. &quot;The Box-Dwelling Phenomenon.&quot; <em>Proceedings of the International Cat Behavior Symposium</em>, 2020.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Controversy section:</strong>
Every good Wikipedia article has one. What's the disputed claim about your subject?</p>
<h2>Example: The Self-Biography</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;<strong>Jane Doe</strong> (born 1985) is an American administrative professional, amateur baker, and unpublished novelist, known primarily for her work in regional office supply procurement and her ongoing contributions to the Smith family WhatsApp group.</p>
<p><strong>Early life and education</strong>
Doe was born in suburban Ohio, the second of three children. She attended Jefferson Elementary School, where she was recognized for her participation in the 1993 spelling bee (eliminated in round three on the word 'necessary').[1] Her early interest in organizing systems would later influence her professional trajectory.[citation needed]</p>
<p><strong>Career</strong>
Following graduation from State University with a degree in Communications (2007), Doe entered the workforce during the economic recession, ultimately finding employment at Midwest Insurance Associates, where she has remained for the subsequent fifteen years.[2]</p>
<p>Her role has expanded to include what scholars term 'emotional labor adjacent to office management,' including remembering coworkers' birthdays and maintaining the break room coffee supply.[3]&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Adding Polish</h2>
<h3>The &quot;See Also&quot; Section</h3>
<p>Link to other absurd articles:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>See also: List of notable housecats, Box-sitting behaviors, Table-clearing phenomena</em></li>
</ul>
<h3>The &quot;References&quot; Section</h3>
<p>Make up plausible sources with proper formatting.</p>
<h3>The &quot;External Links&quot; Section</h3>
<p>Fictional websites, archives, databases.</p>
<h3>Content Warnings</h3>
<p>For extra authenticity: &quot;[This article may require cleanup to meet Wikipedia's quality standards.]&quot;</p>
<h2>Why This Exercise Matters</h2>
<p>Beyond the fun, this project teaches:</p>
<p><strong>How authority is constructed:</strong> The Wikipedia style makes anything sound credible. This is worth understanding.</p>
<p><strong>How to write clearly:</strong> The encyclopedic style forces clarity and precision.</p>
<p><strong>How sourcing works:</strong> Even fake citations make you think about evidence.</p>
<p><strong>How perspective shapes narrative:</strong> The same facts can be presented many ways.</p>
<h2>Sharing Your Work</h2>
<p>Your fake Wikipedia entries make great:</p>
<ul>
<li>Gifts (frame someone's &quot;biography&quot;)</li>
<li>Party entertainment</li>
<li>Social media content</li>
<li>Holiday cards (&quot;Year in Review: A Comprehensive Analysis&quot;)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Taking It Further</h2>
<h3>Write Connected Entries</h3>
<p>Create a whole ecosystem of fake articles that reference each other.</p>
<h3>Write Contradictory Entries</h3>
<p>Two Wikipedia entries about the same event from opposing perspectives.</p>
<h3>Write Future Entries</h3>
<p>Your Wikipedia entry as it will read in 50 years.</p>
<h3>Write Alternate History</h3>
<p>Your town's Wikipedia entry in a world where one thing went differently.</p>
