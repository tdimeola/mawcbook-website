    <h1>Build a Course Curriculum</h1>
<p>Want to learn something new? Have AI design a structured learning path: readings, exercises, projects, assessments.</p>
<h2>Learning Anything</h2>
<p>You can teach yourself almost anything. The hard part isn't finding information, it's organizing it into a coherent path from beginner to competent.</p>
<p>AI excels at this. It knows what topics depend on others, what order makes sense, and what resources exist. You provide the goal; AI provides the map.</p>
<h2>Step 1: Define Your Learning Goal</h2>
<p>Be specific about what you want to learn and why:</p>
<p><strong>Too vague:</strong> &quot;Learn about history&quot;
<strong>Better:</strong> &quot;Understand the causes and consequences of World War I&quot;
<strong>Best:</strong> &quot;Understand WWI well enough to discuss it confidently and recognize its influence on the 20th century&quot;</p>
<p>Ask yourself:</p>
<ul>
<li>What specifically do I want to be able to do?</li>
<li>How deep do I want to go?</li>
<li>How much time can I dedicate?</li>
<li>What's my starting point?</li>
</ul>
<h2>Step 2: Request a Curriculum</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Create a 6-week self-study curriculum for learning basic statistics. I'm a complete beginner with only high school math. I can dedicate 5-6 hours per week. I want to understand statistics well enough to read and critically evaluate research studies.</p>
<p>Include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Weekly topics in logical order</li>
<li>Free online resources (videos, readings)</li>
<li>Practice exercises</li>
<li>One small project per week</li>
<li>A way to assess my understanding&quot;</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<h2>Step 3: Review and Adjust</h2>
<p>AI will generate a first draft. Refine it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Week 2 looks too advanced for where I'll be. Can you add more basics first?&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;I learn better from videos than reading. Can you recommend more video content?&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Add more practice problems. I need repetition to learn math.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Sample Curriculum Topics</h2>
<h3>Languages</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Create a 3-month curriculum for learning conversational Spanish. I know no Spanish. I can practice 30 minutes daily. Focus on speaking and listening, not reading/writing.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Creative Skills</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Design a curriculum for learning digital illustration. I can draw a little on paper but have never used drawing software. I have an iPad with Procreate.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Technical Skills</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Create a curriculum for learning Python programming. I've never coded before. Goal: be able to write simple scripts to automate tasks at work.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Academic Subjects</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Design a self-study curriculum for understanding climate science at an undergraduate level. I have a general science background but no specialization.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Practical Skills</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Create a curriculum for learning home repair basics. I'm not handy at all but want to handle simple maintenance without calling someone.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Professional Development</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Design a curriculum for improving my public speaking skills. I can present adequately but want to become compelling and confident.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Curriculum Components</h2>
<p>A good curriculum includes:</p>
<h3>Core Content</h3>
<p>The main material you'll learn. Readings, videos, tutorials.</p>
<h3>Practice</h3>
<p>Exercises to reinforce learning. Problem sets, drills, application.</p>
<h3>Projects</h3>
<p>Larger activities that combine skills. Real work, not just exercises.</p>
<h3>Assessment</h3>
<p>Ways to check your understanding. Quizzes, self-tests, milestones.</p>
<h3>Resources</h3>
<p>Where to find what you need. Links, books, tools.</p>
<h3>Schedule</h3>
<p>Realistic pacing. What to do when, how long things take.</p>
<h2>Making It Work</h2>
<h3>Start Small</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;This curriculum feels overwhelming. Can you create a 2-week trial version that covers just the fundamentals? If I stick with it, I'll continue.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Build in Review</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Add weekly review sessions and monthly cumulative reviews to help retention.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Connect to Real Life</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;I'm learning Spanish for a trip to Mexico. Can you include travel-specific vocabulary and scenarios?&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Adapt to Your Style</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;I'm an audio learner. Replace the reading suggestions with podcasts or audiobooks where possible.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Tracking Progress</h2>
<p>Ask AI to help you stay on track:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Create a simple tracking sheet for this curriculum. I want to check off completed items and note where I struggled.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Or for accountability:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Design a weekly self-assessment quiz for each week of this curriculum. 5-10 questions that tell me if I really understood the material.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>When You Get Stuck</h2>
<p>Use AI as a tutor:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;I'm on week 3 of my statistics curriculum, learning about standard deviation. I've read the material but I don't really get it. Can you explain it differently? Maybe with a concrete example?&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;I just finished the exercise set on hypothesis testing. Can you walk me through problem 4? I got the wrong answer and don't understand why.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Going Deeper</h2>
<p>Once you complete a curriculum:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;I finished the basic statistics curriculum. What should I learn next if I want to understand data science?&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Or:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;I completed your Python basics curriculum. I want to specialize in web scraping. Create an intermediate curriculum that builds on what I've learned.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Curated Resources</h2>
<p>Ask for specific recommendations:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;What are the 3 best free online courses for learning linear algebra? Compare their approaches so I can pick the right one for me.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Recommend 5 books on learning to draw, ordered from most beginner-friendly to most advanced.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Sample Curriculum Format</h2>
<p>Here's what a good curriculum might look like:</p>
<p><strong>Week 1: Foundations</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><em>Topics:</em> What statistics is, types of data, basic terminology</li>
<li><em>Resources:</em> Khan Academy intro videos (2 hours), Chapter 1 of OpenIntro Statistics</li>
<li><em>Practice:</em> End-of-chapter exercises 1-15</li>
<li><em>Project:</em> Find 3 news articles that use statistics; identify what's being measured</li>
<li><em>Assessment:</em> Can you explain the difference between a population and a sample to a friend?</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Week 2: Describing Data</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><em>Topics:</em> Mean, median, mode, range, variance</li>
<li><em>Resources:</em> ...</li>
</ul>
<p>And so on.</p>
