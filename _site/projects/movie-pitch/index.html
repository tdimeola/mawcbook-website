    <h1>Generate Your Life Story as a Movie Pitch</h1>
<p>What genre is your life? Who plays you? What's the tagline? AI can help you see your own story from a cinematic angle.</p>
<h2>The Hollywood Treatment</h2>
<p>Every life has a narrative arc, themes, dramatic moments, and character development. You just don't usually see them because you're too close.</p>
<p>This project uses AI to reframe your life (or a period of it) as a movie pitch. The result is entertaining, sometimes surprisingly insightful, and makes a great conversation starter.</p>
<h2>Step 1: Gather Your Story Elements</h2>
<p>Think about your life in movie terms:</p>
<p><strong>The Setup:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Where and when were you born?</li>
<li>What was your childhood like?</li>
<li>What defined your early years?</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The Inciting Incident:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>What event changed your direction?</li>
<li>When did life stop being &quot;normal&quot;?</li>
<li>What pushed you into the main story?</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The Journey:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>What challenges have you faced?</li>
<li>What have you learned?</li>
<li>What have you lost and gained?</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The Characters:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Who are the key people in your story?</li>
<li>Who's the mentor? The rival? The love interest?</li>
<li>Who changed you?</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The Theme:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>What's your story really about?</li>
<li>Redemption? Discovery? Love? Survival?</li>
<li>What would the audience take away?</li>
</ul>
<h2>Step 2: Generate Your Pitch</h2>
<p>Share your story with AI and ask for the Hollywood treatment:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Turn my life story into a movie pitch. I'll share the key events and people, and you write it as a professional pitch document.</p>
<p>Background: Born in Chicago, 1985. Parents divorced when I was 7. Raised by single mom who worked two jobs. Always loved music but couldn't afford lessons. Got a scholarship to college, first in my family. Met my spouse there. After college, we moved across the country for their job, and I had to start over professionally. Struggled for years, finally started my own business at 35. It's now successful but the journey was hard.</p>
<p>Give me:</p>
<ul>
<li>Title</li>
<li>Genre</li>
<li>Logline (one sentence hook)</li>
<li>Three-act structure summary</li>
<li>Cast suggestions for who would play us</li>
<li>Tagline for the poster</li>
<li>Comparable films ('for fans of...')&quot;</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<h2>Sample Output</h2>
<p>Based on a life story, AI might generate:</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>TITLE:</strong> <em>Starting Over</em></p>
<p><strong>GENRE:</strong> Drama with comedic moments (think Pursuit of Happyness meets Julie &amp; Julia)</p>
<p><strong>LOGLINE:</strong> A first-generation college graduate must rebuild her life from scratch in a new city, discovering that the dreams she abandoned as a child were pointing her toward her true path all along.</p>
<p><strong>TAGLINE:</strong> &quot;Sometimes you have to lose everything to find yourself.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>CAST:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><em>Sarah (Lead)</em>: America Ferrera</li>
<li><em>Mom</em>: Rita Moreno</li>
<li><em>Spouse</em>: Oscar Isaac</li>
<li><em>Business Mentor</em>: Sandra Oh</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>COMPARABLE FILMS:</strong> The Pursuit of Happyness, Wild, Joy</p>

<h2>Different Angles</h2>
<p>Try different genres for the same life:</p>
<h3>Comedy</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Reframe my story as a comedy. Find the absurdity, the awkward moments, the times things went ridiculously wrong.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Thriller</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Make my story a thriller. What were the stakes? Who were the antagonists? What was I racing against?&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Coming-of-Age</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Focus on my teenage years. What was I learning? What defined that transformation?&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Romance</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Center the romantic relationship. How did we meet? What kept us apart? What brought us together?&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Indie Film</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Make this a quiet indie film. Focus on small moments and internal change rather than big drama.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Focus on a Specific Period</h2>
<p>Instead of your whole life:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Turn just my college years into a movie pitch.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Pitch the two years I spent caring for my sick parent.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Make my career change into a movie.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Pitch my experience becoming a parent.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>The Fun Additions</h2>
<h3>The Trailer</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Write a 200-word movie trailer voiceover for my life story.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>The Soundtrack</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;What songs would be on the soundtrack? Create a tracklist with what scenes they'd play during.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>The Sequel</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;My life story had a sequel hook. What's the next movie about?&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>The Director's Vision</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Write a director's statement explaining the visual style and themes of this film.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>The Review</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Write a 4-star movie review of my life story as if it were a real film.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Making It Personal</h2>
<h3>For Others</h3>
<p>This makes a great gift. Interview a parent, grandparent, or friend, then surprise them with their movie pitch.</p>
<h3>For Milestones</h3>
<ul>
<li>Retirement: Pitch the whole career</li>
<li>Anniversary: Pitch the relationship</li>
<li>Graduation: Pitch the school years</li>
<li>Birthday: Pitch that decade</li>
</ul>
<h3>For Perspective</h3>
<p>When you're going through a hard time, seeing it as a movie moment can help:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;I'm in the middle of a difficult career transition. If this were a movie, what act am I in? What's about to happen?&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>What You'll Learn</h2>
<p>This exercise reveals:</p>
<ul>
<li>Patterns you hadn't noticed</li>
<li>How much you've overcome</li>
<li>The supporting cast who shaped you</li>
<li>That your story is worth telling</li>
</ul>
<h2>Sharing Your Pitch</h2>
<p>Your movie pitch makes great:</p>
<ul>
<li>Social media content</li>
<li>Wedding speech material</li>
<li>Retirement party presentation</li>
<li>Personal reflection</li>
<li>Gift for loved ones</li>
</ul>
