    <h1>Text Adventure: AI as Dungeon Master</h1>
<p>No downloads, no setup. Just ask an LLM to run a text adventure for you. Be a detective, an explorer, a starship captain. The AI adapts to your choices.</p>
<h2>What Is a Text Adventure?</h2>
<p>Before video games had graphics, there were text adventures. You'd read a description of where you were, type what you wanted to do, and the game would respond. It was like reading a book where you controlled the main character.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>You are standing in a dimly lit cavern. Water drips somewhere in the darkness. To the north, a narrow passage leads deeper into the mountain. To the east, you see a faint glow.</strong></p>
<p>&gt; <em>go east</em></p>
<p><strong>You follow the glow and emerge into a vast underground chamber. Bioluminescent mushrooms cover the walls, casting an ethereal blue light. In the center of the chamber sits an ancient stone altar.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>AI language models are perfect for this. They can generate descriptions, respond to your choices, remember context, and improvise when you do something unexpected.</p>
<h2>Getting Started</h2>
<p>Go to any AI assistant (Claude, ChatGPT, Gemini) and try this prompt:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Let's play a text adventure game. You're the narrator and game master. I'm the player. Set the scene, describe my surroundings, and wait for me to tell you what I do. Keep descriptions vivid but concise. Track my inventory and any important information. Let's begin with me as a detective arriving at a mysterious mansion on a stormy night.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The AI will set the scene, and you respond with what you want to do:</p>
<ul>
<li>&quot;Look around the room&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;Open the door&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;Talk to the butler&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;Search the desk for clues&quot;</li>
</ul>
<h2>Genre Ideas</h2>
<h3>Mystery / Detective</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;I'm a private investigator in 1940s Los Angeles. A wealthy widow has hired me to find out who's been stealing from her estate. Start me at the front gate of her mansion.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Fantasy Adventure</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;I'm an apprentice wizard who just discovered a hidden door in the library of my magic school. The door wasn't there yesterday. I decide to investigate.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Science Fiction</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;I'm the captain of a small cargo ship. We've just received a distress signal from a derelict vessel drifting at the edge of known space. We're approaching to investigate.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Horror / Survival</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;I wake up in an abandoned hospital with no memory of how I got here. The power is flickering. I hear footsteps somewhere in the building.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Historical</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;I'm an archaeologist in 1920s Egypt. My team has just uncovered a sealed tomb that doesn't appear on any maps. We're preparing to enter.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Slice of Life</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;I just inherited a run-down cafe in a small coastal town. It's my first day trying to reopen it. Show me the space and the challenges ahead.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Tips for Better Adventures</h2>
<p><strong>Set clear expectations:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Give me 2-3 choices at key decision points, but also let me try things not on the list. Include sensory details. If I do something dangerous, let there be real consequences.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Ask for a character:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Before we start, create a character for me with a name, a background, and a special skill. Then start the adventure.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Request tracking:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Keep track of my inventory, important NPCs I meet, and clues I discover. If I ask for a status update, summarize what I know.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Establish the tone:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Keep the tone light and adventurous with moments of humor&quot; or &quot;Make it atmospheric and suspenseful, like a thriller novel&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Set stakes:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;My character can fail and face consequences. Don't protect me from bad decisions, but give me fair warning when something seems dangerous.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Example Play Session</h2>
<p><strong>You:</strong> Let's play a text adventure. I'm a space salvager exploring a derelict ship. Make it atmospheric and a little creepy.</p>
<p><strong>AI:</strong> <em>The airlock hisses as it cycles, and you step into the USS Meridian. Your helmet light cuts through the darkness, revealing a corridor caked with frost. The ship has been dead for six months, according to the distress beacon. No one should be here.</em></p>
<p><em>Your scanner shows faint power signatures deeper in the vessel. The corridor branches: left toward crew quarters, right toward engineering.</em></p>
<p><em>What do you do?</em></p>
<p><strong>You:</strong> Check my equipment first. What do I have?</p>
<p><strong>AI:</strong> <em>You take stock of your gear:</em></p>
<ul>
<li><em>Magnetic boots (active)</em></li>
<li><em>Plasma cutter (full charge)</em></li>
<li><em>Scanner (showing that power signature)</em></li>
<li><em>Emergency oxygen: 4 hours</em></li>
<li><em>Empty salvage bag</em></li>
<li><em>Personal sidearm (you've never had to use it)</em></li>
</ul>
<p><em>The frost on the walls sparkles in your light. The silence is absolute.</em></p>
<p><strong>You:</strong> Go left toward crew quarters. Move slowly and stay alert.</p>
<p>And the adventure continues...</p>
<h2>Advanced: Collaborative Worldbuilding</h2>
<p>You can also use AI to help <em>design</em> an adventure before playing:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Help me design a text adventure setting. I want a mystery aboard a luxury train traveling through an alternate-history Europe. We'll create the train, the passengers, and the central mystery together, then play through it.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This gives you a richer, more personalized experience.</p>
<h2>Other Text Adventure Options</h2>
<p>If you want more structured experiences:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>AI Dungeon</strong> (<a href="https://aidungeon.com">aidungeon.com</a>) - Dedicated text adventure platform</li>
<li><strong>NovelAI</strong> (<a href="https://novelai.net">novelai.net</a>) - Story-focused AI with adventure modes</li>
</ul>
<p>But honestly, a regular AI assistant works remarkably well for this, and you have more control over the experience.</p>
