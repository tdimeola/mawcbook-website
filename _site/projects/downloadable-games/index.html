    <h1>Downloadable AI Games</h1>
<p>For deeper experiences: games that use AI in interesting ways and run on your own machine.</p>
<h2>Why Downloadable?</h2>
<p>Browser games are convenient, but downloadable games can offer:</p>
<ul>
<li>Deeper, longer experiences</li>
<li>Better graphics and performance</li>
<li>Offline play</li>
<li>More sophisticated AI systems</li>
</ul>
<p>These games use AI for everything from generating endless content to creating believable characters to building entire worlds.</p>

<h3>Dwarf Fortress</h3>
<p><strong>Platforms:</strong> PC (Steam version has graphics)

<h3>Alien: Isolation</h3>
<p><strong>Platforms:</strong> PC, PlayStation, Xbox, Switch

<h3>Left 4 Dead 2</h3>
<p><strong>Platforms:</strong> PC, Xbox
<strong>Price:</strong> $10</p>
