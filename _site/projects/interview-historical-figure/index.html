    <h1>Interview a Historical Figure</h1>
<p>Have a conversation with Marie Curie, Einstein, Cleopatra, or anyone who fascinates you. You'll learn something about history, and you'll discover how well AI handles nuance and character.</p>
<h2>Why This Works</h2>
<p>AI language models have been trained on vast amounts of text, including biographies, letters, speeches, and historical documents. When you ask an AI to take on a historical persona, it can draw on all that knowledge to create a surprisingly authentic conversation.</p>
<p>This isn't just a party trick. It's a genuinely useful way to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Learn about historical periods from a personal perspective</li>
<li>Explore &quot;what if&quot; questions</li>
<li>Understand different viewpoints from history</li>
<li>Make history more engaging and memorable</li>
</ul>
<h2>How to Start</h2>
<p>Go to any of the LLMs from <a href="/projects/try-different-llms/">Project 1</a>. If you haven't set one up yet, start there first.</p>
<p>Then try a prompt like this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;I'd like to have a conversation with Marie Curie. Please take on her persona and respond as she might have, drawing on what's known about her personality, her work, and her life. I'll ask questions and you respond as Marie Curie would. Stay in character throughout our conversation.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The AI will respond as Marie Curie, and you can start asking questions.</p>
<h2>Sample Questions to Ask</h2>
<p>Once the AI is in character, try questions like:</p>
<p><strong>About their work:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>&quot;What discovery are you most proud of?&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;What was your biggest failure or setback?&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;What do you wish people understood better about your work?&quot;</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>About their life:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>&quot;What was a typical day like for you?&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;Who influenced you the most?&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;What do you do to relax?&quot;</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>About their inner world:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>&quot;What keeps you up at night?&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;Do you have any regrets?&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;What advice would you give to young people?&quot;</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Connecting past and present:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>&quot;What would surprise you most about the world today?&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;How do you think your work has affected the modern world?&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;What problems today do you wish you could help solve?&quot;</li>
</ul>
<h2>Interesting Figures to Try</h2>
<h3>Scientists and Inventors</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Marie Curie</strong> - Pioneering physicist, first woman to win a Nobel Prize</li>
<li><strong>Albert Einstein</strong> - Theoretical physicist who reimagined space and time</li>
<li><strong>Ada Lovelace</strong> - The first computer programmer</li>
<li><strong>Nikola Tesla</strong> - Inventor and electrical engineer</li>
<li><strong>Charles Darwin</strong> - Naturalist who developed the theory of evolution</li>
</ul>
<h3>Leaders and Revolutionaries</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Cleopatra</strong> - Last pharaoh of Egypt</li>
<li><strong>Abraham Lincoln</strong> - U.S. president during the Civil War</li>
<li><strong>Harriet Tubman</strong> - Abolitionist and conductor on the Underground Railroad</li>
<li><strong>Mahatma Gandhi</strong> - Leader of Indian independence movement</li>
<li><strong>Eleanor Roosevelt</strong> - First Lady, diplomat, and activist</li>
</ul>
<h3>Artists and Writers</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Leonardo da Vinci</strong> - Renaissance polymath</li>
<li><strong>Frida Kahlo</strong> - Mexican painter known for self-portraits</li>
<li><strong>William Shakespeare</strong> - Playwright and poet</li>
<li><strong>Jane Austen</strong> - Novelist who explored society and relationships</li>
<li><strong>Vincent van Gogh</strong> - Post-impressionist painter</li>
</ul>
<h3>Philosophers and Thinkers</h3>
<ul>

<li><strong>Mary Wollstonecraft</strong> - Early advocate for women's rights</li>
<li><strong>Frederick Douglass</strong> - Abolitionist, writer, and orator</li>
</ul>
<h2>Tips for Better Conversations</h2>
<p><strong>Set the scene.</strong> You can specify a time period:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Let's say it's 1905, just after you've published your paper on special relativity.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Ask for opinions.</strong> Historical figures had strong views:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;What do you think of [contemporary figure or idea]?&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Explore disagreements.</strong> Interview two figures who disagreed:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Now I'd like to talk to Thomas Edison about the same topic.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Go beyond the famous stuff.</strong> Ask about their daily life, their doubts, their friendships.</p>
<p><strong>Push back.</strong> If an answer seems too generic, ask for specifics:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Can you give me a specific example?&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>What You'll Notice</h2>
<p>Different AI models handle historical personas differently:</p>
<ul>
<li>Some stay strictly in character</li>
<li>Some break character to clarify historical facts</li>
<li>Some are more willing to speculate about the person's inner thoughts</li>
</ul>
<p>Try the same historical figure on Claude, ChatGPT, and Gemini. You might be surprised how different the conversations feel.</p>
<h2>A Note on Accuracy</h2>
<p>The AI is drawing on historical sources, but it's also filling in gaps with plausible guesses. The conversations are educational and entertaining, but they're not transcripts of what these people actually said.</p>
<p>For important historical facts, verify with reliable sources. But for getting a feel for a person and their era, these conversations can be remarkably illuminating.</p>
